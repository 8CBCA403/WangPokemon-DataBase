This savefile contains a legit generation 1 Mew distributed in Finland in the year 2000.

Credit goes to Vezokair for finding and dumping the savefile containing the Mew.

The savefile contains multiple mews and  the savefile might have been glitched at some point, but the mews are all clones of the same original Mew and as far as the inner data goes the mews are legit and not obtained trough any in-game glitch.

You can read more about the story of this Mew here:
