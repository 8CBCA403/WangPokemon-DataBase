*I'll update the package with a better readme in the future.

- Gen3 Event Tool 0.1.exe: a simple program to inject Nintendo events to your savegames. Just drag and drop. Notice

- Mystery Gift Tool 0.1.exe: this tool has "Gen3 Event Tool 0.1" embedded, and also the following:
	- Wonder News editor/injector/extractor
	- Wonder Card editor/injector/extractor
	- Mystery Event editor/injector/extractor
	- e-Trainer editor/injector/extractor
	- e-Berry editor/injector/extractor
	- Ruby/Saphire/Emerald secret base decoration editor
	- Ruby/Saphire/Emerald TV program and Swarm Editor
	- For researchers: function to export current savegame with sorted blocks, for easy hex comparision between savegames.

Everything supports drag and drop. Bugs are to be expected in this first release, but it's main goal, event injection/extraction should work without problems.

A collection of official nintendo events is included in this package as wc3 and me3 files. Please refer to events.txt for more information.


Note: savegame detection algorythm is not perfect, make sure the correct region and language are selected, if not, use the override button.
