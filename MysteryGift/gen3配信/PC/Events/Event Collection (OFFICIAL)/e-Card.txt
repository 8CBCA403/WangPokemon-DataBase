e-Card Berries.zip and e-Card Trainers.zip contain a collection of official e-Card Berries (.ecb) and e-Card Trainer (.ect) files.

Originally, you'd scan the card with the e-Reader, then connect the e-Reader and your game via Link Cable and the corresponding trainer or berry data would be stored in the savegame (until a new transfer for another berry or trainer was done).

Injecting an ect or ecb to the savegame has the same result as doing it with the e-Reader, nothing more, nothing less. The original cards where region locked, but you can inject any ect or ecb regardless of region and it will work just fine.

Thanks BlackShark for converting the e-Card files to ect and ecb!

Enjoy
