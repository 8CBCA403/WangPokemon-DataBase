This is a list of the events included in the package and who contributed them.

- WN_JAP_Empty.wn3 and WN_USAEUR_Empty.wn3 are empty Wonder News files compatible with the editor, so you can create your own Wonder News. These news were only used in Japan, and there's currently no public domain savegame containing Wonder News. If you have one, please contribute it at projectpokemon.org!

- Event Collection (OFFICIAL): holds .wc3 and .me3 files with official nintendo events.

- Shareable Wondercards (SEMI-OFFICIAL): holds modified .wc3 files that can be shared via wireless adaptor. The receiver CAN'T share the wondercard, but the wondercard received is 1:1 to the one received via a Nintendo Event, and as such, a cartridge with one of this wondercards can be used as a distribution device for the event.

- Custom Events (ILLEGAL): holds .wc3 and .me3 files that have been made by hand, so they aren't official in any way. Check the included readme in the folder to know more about each file in the folder.
