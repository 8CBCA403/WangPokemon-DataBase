# NDS Mystery Event Distributor
-------------------------------

This is based on nds-savegame-manager, a NDS homebrew tool by Pokedoc to rip and restore saves from DS and GBA games.

This modification works with Pokémon GBA games and allows to inject official Nintendo Events to the savegames in the cartridge.

Please, consider making a backup with the standard homebrew by Pokedoc (https://code.google.com/p/savegame-manager/).
